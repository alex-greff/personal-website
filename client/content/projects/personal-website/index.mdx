A series of personal websites projects developed from scratch by myself. The
motivation behind these projects was for me to become familiar with modern
web development principles and design. 

<br />

# Version 3

The most current iteration of the project (and the site that you are reading
this on). It is built using React, TypeScript and Gatsby. My reasoning for
developing this iteration is that I was not entirely satisfied with the design
of V2 which gave me the opportunity switch to using a React/TypeScript based
stack.

<br />

# Version 2

An upgrade of V1 that ported to be statically generated using Vue with Gridsome.
I chose to switch to a static site because V1 was quite overkill and really did
not suit my needs for the website.

<br />

# Version 1

The first (slightly overkill) iteration of the website. Built with a dedicated 
RESTful backend, the project used Node JS/Express with the frontend using Vue
and MongoDB as the database. The entire application was deployed using Docker
through a continuous-integration (CI) pipeline with Travis CI to a Digital
Ocean droplet.
