A web app built in a team of two that syncs audio files across multiple peers
using WebRTC via the PeerJS library. The responsive frontend client was built
using Vue.js, TypeScript and SASS/SCSS. Backend services built with Node.js
manage rooms and signalling for peer-to-peer connection initialization.
