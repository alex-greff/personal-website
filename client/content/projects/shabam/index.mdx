A replica of the popular music-recognition app, Shazam, implemented from 
scratch. The digital signal processing (DSP) of the audio is done in on the
frontend using C compiled to WebAssembly and Web Workers to make performance 
faster and more consistent. The backend is built using Node JS and GraphQL 
and provides a powerful API interface for the client. Worker nodes are used by 
the backend API to offload audio searching and storage management. The project 
is containerized with Docker allowing for the ability to deploy with high 
horizontal scalability.
