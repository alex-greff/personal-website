A linux-inspired command shell using Java which was done as the final project
for CSCB07: Software Design. The project was developed in a team of 4, adhering 
to Agile/Scrum methodologies. The command implementations were built on a
reusable and maintainable framework, utilizing SOLID design-principles and
common design patterns to do so.
